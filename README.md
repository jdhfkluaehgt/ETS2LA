If you are from China you need to use start_tsinghua.bat and clone from Gitlab in addition to using the tsinghua pypi mirror in the launcher too.

Once you've downloaded and unpacked the file you can run start.bat . Initially it will install our own copies of git and python, so you will need to wait for a moment before the installer itself comes up :Okay: 

 Any time you want to open the app you can run on start.bat.
